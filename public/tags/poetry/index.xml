      <description>Shall I compare thee to a summer&amp;rsquo;s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer&amp;rsquo;s lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed,
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature&amp;rsquo;s changing course untrimmed:
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow&amp;rsquo;st,</description>

      <title>T&#39;was the Night Before Christmas</title>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Twas The Night Before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
The children have nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mamma in her &amp;lsquo;kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled down for a long winter&amp;rsquo;s nap,</description>

      <title>I Wandered Lonely As A Could</title>

      <description>I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o&amp;rsquo;er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</description>

      <title>That It Will Never Come Again</title>

      <description>That it will never come again
Is what makes life so sweet.
Believing what we don’t believe
Does not exhilarate.
That if it be, it be at best
An ablative estate &amp;ndash;
This instigates an appetite
Precisely opposite.</description>

      <description>If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:</description>

      <title>Trees</title>

      <description>I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in Summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me,</description>
