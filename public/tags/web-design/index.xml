      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;m getting back into designing websites for fun. I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript several years ago on freecodeCamp and I really enjoyed it, but somehow got out of practice a few years ago.
I then found WordPress and built quite a few sites in that, but there wasn&amp;rsquo;t really much coding involved it that. Over the past few years I&amp;rsquo;ve been practicing using Python quite a bit to write scripts to make my life easier, some of which I may post here at some point in the future.</description>
