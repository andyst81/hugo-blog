      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;m getting back into designing websites for fun. I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript several years ago through freecodeCamp and I really enjoyed it, but somehow got out of practice a few years ago.
When I had a need to build a few websites several years ago, instead of putting the web design principles that I had already learned, I decided to use WordPress. I built quite a few sites using WordPress and some themes, but I always felt that it was kinda cheating - not really web design.</description>
