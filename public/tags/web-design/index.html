  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>So I&rsquo;m getting back into designing websites for fun. I started learning HTML,
CSS and JavaScript several years ago through freecodeCamp and I really enjoyed it,
but somehow got out of practice a few years ago.</p>

<p>When I had a need to build a few websites several years ago, instead of putting
the web design principles that I had already learned, I decided to use WordPress.
I built quite a few sites using WordPress and some themes, but I always felt
that it was kinda cheating - not really web design. I still maintained an interest
in programming, but was mostly focused on learning and using Python. I plan to
write some future blog posts about Python as I really enjoy writing Python scripts.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been learning more about static site generators and think I&rsquo;ve
found what I was looking for all those years ago. I love the idea of SSGs and
have been playing around with quite a lot of them, including Gatsby,
Jekyll, 11ty, Middleman, and Hugo (which I&rsquo;m using to build this site).</p>

<p>Of the SSGs that I&rsquo;ve been playing around with, I feel that Hugo is the most
straight-forward and fun to use. I&rsquo;m a bit of a beginner when it comes to GoLang,
but I really like the idea of it, and it seems to make most sense to me. I will
look further into 11ty and Gatsby for future projects as I really enjoyed
playing around with both of them.</p>

<p>I produce content for several blogs that I run, as well as this one. My wife is
also a contributor to several sites too. She&rsquo;s not really a technical person, so
I&rsquo;ve also been playing around with a few headless CMS, so that we both can create
content on the go, from anywhere. I think I&rsquo;ve found the one I like now called
Sanity.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll post a review of Sanity in a future blog, along with some of the
other tools I&rsquo;ve been playing around with, such as Netlify, Netlify CMS,
Zeit Now, and the other SSGs that I posted about earlier.</p>

<p>Learning to do front-end web design has been a goal of mine for quite
some time and I&rsquo;m really happy to be working towards it now.</p>

<p>Stay cool everyone - until next time.</p>
