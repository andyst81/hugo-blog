      <description>&amp;lsquo;Twas The Night Before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
The children have nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mamma in her &amp;lsquo;kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled down for a long winter&amp;rsquo;s nap,</description>
