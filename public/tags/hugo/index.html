  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed playing around with Hugo over the past few weeks and am now
using it to build another site for my wife. That site is almost complete, which is
why I haven&rsquo;t really posted much in this site for a while. I have been playing around and adding several small things to this site though.</p>

<p>One very cool addition to the site has been a Disqus comment function. It was very
easy to set up as part of the Hugo framework and really worthwhile. I don&rsquo;t expect
a lot of comments on this blog as it is very much a collection of the information
I write as I put this website together.</p>

<p>Anyway, how to add Disqus to a Hugo site:</p>

<p>It really is as simple as signing up for a Disqus account at <a href="https://disqus.com">https://disqus.com</a>.
Even this step is as easy as possible as you can simply register using either
Facebook, Twitter or Google. You can create the traditional way too, but I just used Twitter.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve created your account, you will be asked something like &ldquo;Nice! Your account has been created. What would you like to do with Disqus?  I want to comment on sites.<br />
I want to install Disqus on my site.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fill in the form and create a unique Disqus name for your site - e.g. my-disqus-site-name. Remember this name -
you will then go to your config.toml file in Hugo and enter the following information</p>

<p>disqusShortname = &ldquo;my-disqus-site-name&rdquo;</p>

<p>You will then be able to put the following inbuilt shortcode into the code of any page
you want to have comments on:</p>

<pre><code>{{ template &quot;_internal/disqus.html&quot; . }}
</code></pre>

<p>Personally I just put the above shortcode at the bottom of my blog post template, &ldquo;single.html&rdquo;. I think the most difficult part of this whole process was using my site name - stupidly I was using my own username for Disqus and wondering why it wasn&rsquo;t working!</p>

<p>Another small, but cool things I&rsquo;ve added is a link to my <a href="https://dev.to">https://dev.to</a> profile.
dev.to is a massive inspiration for me and I really enjoy reading content on there.
If you&rsquo;re interested in coding and are not a member, I strongly suggest you check it out.</p>

  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>I&rsquo;ve been working on this blog for some time now and I think it&rsquo;s worthwhile
to document what I&rsquo;ve done so far, just in case it&rsquo;s helpful for other people.
I mentioned in a previous post that I&rsquo;m building this site with Hugo static site
generator. Initially I followed a tutorial from Zachary Wade Betz, on how to
build a Hugo blog from scratch. The tutorial can be found here <a href="https://zwbetz.com/make-a-hugo-blog-from-scratch/">Hugo Tutorial</a> and truly is
a great way to get accustomed to the structure of Hugo and how to use it to build
a great website.</p>

<p>If you follow along with the tutorial, you will see the similarities in styling between this site and the one created in the tutorial. Since completing the tutorial, I have
made a few modifications to the site to make it more inline with what I like.
The first modification I made was to move from Bootstrap to Skeleton. I&rsquo;ve always
found Bootstrap to be quite unwieldy due to the sheer number of options it has.
As such, I was on the lookout for a similar, but much easier to handle framework
and I believe I have found that - <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a>.</p>

<p>Skeleton is a very lightweight boilerplate for simple web design. It is only
around 400 lines of CSS, focused on the most common HTML elements. It&rsquo;s certainly
not suitable for every project, but for a simple blog with minimal styling, it&rsquo;s
perfect. The best part is that it&rsquo;s not a million miles away from Bootstrap, so
the conversion was fairly painless. I had to reclassify a few elements, but the
whole process of migrating to Skeleton from Bootstrap probably look less than an
hour.</p>

<p>To make the migration, I simply downloaded the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhg/Skeleton/master/css/skeleton.css">Skeleton CSS file</a>, as well as the
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhg/Skeleton/master/css/normalize.css">Normalize CSS</a>
files and copied them into the &lsquo;static/css&rsquo; directory of my blog project. I made sure to
search for Bootstrap across the whole project and made sure to link to
Skeleton instead. Then I created a &lsquo;stylesheet.css&rsquo; file to manually add any other
stylings required.</p>

<p>After migrating to Skeleton, the next thing I wanted to do was migrate the icons to
FontAwesome. I&rsquo;m a pro FontAwesome subscriber after contributing to their
KickStarter campaign for FA5 several years ago. FontAwesome have a lot more icons
to choose from and I think their icons just look a bit better too, so the switch
was a good move for me. Again this didn&rsquo;t take a huge amount of time. I had to
create a kit inside FontAwesome and put the link to that kit in my &lsquo;head.html&rsquo; partial.
Then I had to rename the &ldquo;Pre&rdquo; section for each menu item in &lsquo;config.toml&rsquo; to the FontAwesome name. I also went through and changed the other icons in the blog,
such as the &lsquo;tags&rsquo;.</p>

<p>On the subject of fonts, I also changed the typography of the site by adding a
couple of Google Fonts to the site. This was simply a matter of finding the fonts
that I like and copying the convenient code Google Fonts provides into my
&lsquo;stylesheet.css&rsquo; file and editing the relevant elements.</p>

<p>The most difficult thing I did was creating a responsive mobile &lsquo;hamburger&rsquo; menu.
I looked through quite a lot of responsive Hugo themes and tried to copy from them,
but I kept running into problems - either with the styling, or messing up the menu
on desktop or even just disappearing completely. In the end I was able to modify
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp">this tutorial</a>
from W3. On Skeleton, the code in this tutorial worked well, after a little tweaking
of classes.</p>

<p>I used the &lsquo;Audit&rsquo; function in Google Chrome to analyse the site&rsquo;s performance and
there were a lot of minor tweaks required to improve the scores there, but that&rsquo;s
a post for another time.</p>

<p>I still have several other things that I want to implement on this blog. Next up
I will add a function to add comments, and I will also add pagination once I have more
than 10 posts. I&rsquo;d also like to implement a &lsquo;robots.txt&rsquo; file, even though I realise it&rsquo;s not really that necessary for a site like this - I just want to do more things.I&rsquo;m sure that I&rsquo;m not done with the styling yet either.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>This is my first mini update of this blog. I&rsquo;ve been learning more and more about Hugo to build out this website and feel like I&rsquo;m getting the hang of it now. I think Hugo
is a great, easy to access SSG that is incredibly powerful and so fast. The way
it generates static sites is really quite incredible. I really like it. There has
been a bit of a learning curve, and there are still plenty of things that I
still don&rsquo;t know how to do, but it hasn&rsquo;t been anywhere near as complicated as
I thought it would be. As a bonus, compared to generating posts in WordPress
this really feels like I&rsquo;m doing something cool and actually programming,
as opposed publishing the equivalent of a Word document online.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep learning as I have a long way to go. I want to make the home page of
this site much better looking and I have many other additions that I&rsquo;d like to
make. In addition to that, I am still working on my other programming skills.
One thing that I want to learn is how to deploy an existing code script
into a web app. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get to do that soon.</p>

  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>So I&rsquo;m getting back into designing websites for fun. I started learning HTML,
CSS and JavaScript several years ago through freecodeCamp and I really enjoyed it,
but somehow got out of practice a few years ago.</p>

<p>When I had a need to build a few websites several years ago, instead of putting
the web design principles that I had already learned, I decided to use WordPress.
I built quite a few sites using WordPress and some themes, but I always felt
that it was kinda cheating - not really web design. I still maintained an interest
in programming, but was mostly focused on learning and using Python. I plan to
write some future blog posts about Python as I really enjoy writing Python scripts.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been learning more about static site generators and think I&rsquo;ve
found what I was looking for all those years ago. I love the idea of SSGs and
have been playing around with quite a lot of them, including Gatsby,
Jekyll, 11ty, Middleman, and Hugo (which I&rsquo;m using to build this site).</p>

<p>Of the SSGs that I&rsquo;ve been playing around with, I feel that Hugo is the most
straight-forward and fun to use. I&rsquo;m a bit of a beginner when it comes to GoLang,
but I really like the idea of it, and it seems to make most sense to me. I will
look further into 11ty and Gatsby for future projects as I really enjoyed
playing around with both of them.</p>

<p>I produce content for several blogs that I run, as well as this one. My wife is
also a contributor to several sites too. She&rsquo;s not really a technical person, so
I&rsquo;ve also been playing around with a few headless CMS, so that we both can create
content on the go, from anywhere. I think I&rsquo;ve found the one I like now called
Sanity.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll post a review of Sanity in a future blog, along with some of the
other tools I&rsquo;ve been playing around with, such as Netlify, Netlify CMS,
Zeit Now, and the other SSGs that I posted about earlier.</p>

<p>Learning to do front-end web design has been a goal of mine for quite
some time and I&rsquo;m really happy to be working towards it now.</p>

<p>Stay cool everyone - until next time.</p>
