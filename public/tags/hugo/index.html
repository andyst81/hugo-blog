  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>So this is my first mini update of this blog. I&rsquo;ve been learning the technologies
I mentioned in my last post and feel like I&rsquo;m getting the hang of a few things now.
The way this method generates static sites in really incredible. I really like it.
Compared to generating posts in WordPress this really feels like I&rsquo;m doing something
cool and actually programming, as opposed to just making web pages.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep learning as I have a long way to go. One thing that I want to learn is
how to deploy an existing code script into a web app. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get to do that
soon.</p>

  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>So I&rsquo;m getting back into designing websites for fun. I started learning HTML,
CSS and JavaScript several years ago on freecodeCamp and I really enjoyed it,
but somehow got out of practice a few years ago.</p>

<p>I then found WordPress and built quite a few sites in that, but there wasn&rsquo;t
really much coding involved it that. Over the past few years I&rsquo;ve been
practicing using Python quite a bit to write scripts to make my life easier,
some of which I may post here at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve really been getting into static site generators and think I&rsquo;ve
found what I was looking for all those years ago. I love the idea of SSGs and
have been playing around with quite a lot of them, including Gatsby,
Jekyll, 11ty, Middleman, and Hugo (which I&rsquo;m using for this site now).</p>

<p>I produce content for several blogs that I run, as well as this one. My wife is
also a contributor to several sites too. She&rsquo;s not really a technical person, so
I&rsquo;ve also been playing around with a few headless CMS, so that we both can create
content on the go, from anywhere. I think I&rsquo;ve found the one I like now called
Sanity. I&rsquo;ll post a review of Sanity in a future blog, along with some of the
other toolsI&rsquo;ve been playing around with, such as Netlify, Netlify CMS,
Zeit Now, and the other SSGs that I posted about earlier.</p>

<p>Learning to properly do front-end web design has been a goal of mine for quite
some time and I&rsquo;m really happy to be working towards it now.</p>

<p>Stay cool everyone - until next time.</p>
