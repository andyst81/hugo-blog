      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed playing around with Hugo over the past few weeks and am now using it to build another site for my wife. That site is almost complete, which is why I haven&amp;rsquo;t really posted much in this site for a while. I have been playing around and adding several small things to this site though.
One very cool addition to the site has been a Disqus comment function. It was very easy to set up as part of the Hugo framework and really worthwhile.</description>
