      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed playing around with Hugo over the past few weeks and am now using it to build another site for my wife. That site is almost complete, which is why I haven&amp;rsquo;t really posted much in this site for a while. I have been playing around and adding several small things to this site though.
One very cool addition to the site has been a Disqus comment function. It was very easy to set up as part of the Hugo framework and really worthwhile.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this blog for some time now and I think it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile to document what I&amp;rsquo;ve done so far, just in case it&amp;rsquo;s helpful for other people. I mentioned in a previous post that I&amp;rsquo;m building this site with Hugo static site generator. Initially I followed a tutorial from Zachary Wade Betz, on how to build a Hugo blog from scratch. The tutorial can be found here Hugo Tutorial and truly is a great way to get accustomed to the structure of Hugo and how to use it to build a great website.</description>
