      <description>This is my first mini update of this blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning more and more about Hugo to build out this website and feel like I&amp;rsquo;m getting the hang of it now. I think Hugo is a great, easy to access SSG that is incredibly powerful and so fast. The way it generates static sites is really quite incredible. I really like it. There has been a bit of a learning curve, and there are still plenty of things that I still don&amp;rsquo;t know how to do, but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been anywhere near as complicated as I thought it would be.</description>

      <title>My First Real Post</title>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;m getting back into designing websites for fun. I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript several years ago through freecodeCamp and I really enjoyed it, but somehow got out of practice a few years ago.
When I had a need to build a few websites several years ago, instead of putting the web design principles that I had already learned, I decided to use WordPress. I built quite a few sites using WordPress and some themes, but I always felt that it was kinda cheating - not really web design.</description>
