      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed playing around with Hugo over the past few weeks and am now using it to build another site for my wife. That site is almost complete, which is why I haven&amp;rsquo;t really posted much in this site for a while. I have been playing around and adding several small things to this site though.
One very cool addition to the site has been a Disqus comment function. It was very easy to set up as part of the Hugo framework and really worthwhile.</description>

      <title>I Wandered Lonely As A Could</title>

      <description>I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o&amp;rsquo;er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</description>

      <title>Blog Building</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this blog for some time now and I think it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile to document what I&amp;rsquo;ve done so far, just in case it&amp;rsquo;s helpful for other people. I mentioned in a previous post that I&amp;rsquo;m building this site with Hugo static site generator. Initially I followed a tutorial from Zachary Wade Betz, on how to build a Hugo blog from scratch. The tutorial can be found here Hugo Tutorial and truly is a great way to get accustomed to the structure of Hugo and how to use it to build a great website.</description>

      <title>Quick Update</title>

      <description>This is my first mini update of this blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning more and more about Hugo to build out this website and feel like I&amp;rsquo;m getting the hang of it now. I think Hugo is a great, easy to access SSG that is incredibly powerful and so fast. The way it generates static sites is really quite incredible. I really like it. There has been a bit of a learning curve, and there are still plenty of things that I still don&amp;rsquo;t know how to do, but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been anywhere near as complicated as I thought it would be.</description>

      <title>My First Real Post</title>
      <link>https://bootlegninja.space/blog/my-first-real-post/</link>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;m getting back into designing websites for fun. I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript several years ago through freecodeCamp and I really enjoyed it, but somehow got out of practice a few years ago.
When I had a need to build a few websites several years ago, instead of putting the web design principles that I had already learned, I decided to use WordPress. I built quite a few sites using WordPress and some themes, but I always felt that it was kinda cheating - not really web design.</description>

      <title>That It Will Never Come Again</title>

      <description>That it will never come again
Is what makes life so sweet.
Believing what we don’t believe
Does not exhilarate.
That if it be, it be at best
An ablative estate &amp;ndash;
This instigates an appetite
Precisely opposite.</description>

      <description>If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:</description>

      <title>Trees</title>

      <description>I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in Summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me,</description>
