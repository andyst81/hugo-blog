      <description>So this is my first mini update of this blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning the technologies I mentioned in my last post and feel like I&amp;rsquo;m getting the hang of a few things now. The way this method generates static sites in really incredible. I really like it. Compared to generating posts in WordPress this really feels like I&amp;rsquo;m doing something cool and actually programming, as opposed to just making web pages.</description>

      <title>My First Real Post</title>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;m getting back into designing websites for fun. I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript several years ago on freecodeCamp and I really enjoyed it, but somehow got out of practice a few years ago.
I then found WordPress and built quite a few sites in that, but there wasn&amp;rsquo;t really much coding involved it that. Over the past few years I&amp;rsquo;ve been practicing using Python quite a bit to write scripts to make my life easier, some of which I may post here at some point in the future.</description>

      <title>That It Will Never Come Again</title>

      <description>That it will never come again
Is what makes life so sweet.
Believing what we don’t believe
Does not exhilarate.
That if it be, it be at best
An ablative estate &amp;ndash;
This instigates an appetite
Precisely opposite.</description>

      <description>If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:</description>

      <title>Trees</title>

      <description>I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day,
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in Summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me,</description>
