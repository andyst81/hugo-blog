  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>I&rsquo;ve been working on this blog for some time now and I think it&rsquo;s worthwhile
to document what I&rsquo;ve done so far, just in case it&rsquo;s helpful for other people.
I mentioned in a previous post that I&rsquo;m building this site with Hugo static site
generator. Initially I followed a tutorial from Zachary Wade Betz, on how to
build a Hugo blog from scratch. The tutorial can be found here:
<img src="https://zwbetz.com/make-a-hugo-blog-from-scratch/" alt="Hugo Tutorial" /> and truly is
a great way to get accustomed to the structure of Hugo and how to use it to build
a great website.</p>

<p>If you follow the tutorial, you will see the similarities in styling between this
site and the one created in the tutorial.</p>

  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>This is my first mini update of this blog. I&rsquo;ve been learning more and more about Hugo to build out this website and feel like I&rsquo;m getting the hang of it now. I think Hugo
is a great, easy to access SSG that is incredibly powerful and so fast. The way
it generates static sites is really quite incredible. I really like it. There has
been a bit of a learning curve, and there are still plenty of things that I
still don&rsquo;t know how to do, but it hasn&rsquo;t been anywhere near as complicated as
I thought it would be. As a bonus, compared to generating posts in WordPress
this really feels like I&rsquo;m doing something cool and actually programming,
as opposed publishing the equivalent of a Word document online.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep learning as I have a long way to go. I want to make the home page of
this site much better looking and I have many other additions that I&rsquo;d like to
make. In addition to that, I am still working on my other programming skills.
One thing that I want to learn is how to deploy an existing code script
into a web app. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get to do that soon.</p>

  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>So I&rsquo;m getting back into designing websites for fun. I started learning HTML,
CSS and JavaScript several years ago through freecodeCamp and I really enjoyed it,
but somehow got out of practice a few years ago.</p>

<p>When I had a need to build a few websites several years ago, instead of putting
the web design principles that I had already learned, I decided to use WordPress.
I built quite a few sites using WordPress and some themes, but I always felt
that it was kinda cheating - not really web design. I still maintained an interest
in programming, but was mostly focused on learning and using Python. I plan to
write some future blog posts about Python as I really enjoy writing Python scripts.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been learning more about static site generators and think I&rsquo;ve
found what I was looking for all those years ago. I love the idea of SSGs and
have been playing around with quite a lot of them, including Gatsby,
Jekyll, 11ty, Middleman, and Hugo (which I&rsquo;m using to build this site).</p>

<p>Of the SSGs that I&rsquo;ve been playing around with, I feel that Hugo is the most
straight-forward and fun to use. I&rsquo;m a bit of a beginner when it comes to GoLang,
but I really like the idea of it, and it seems to make most sense to me. I will
look further into 11ty and Gatsby for future projects as I really enjoyed
playing around with both of them.</p>

<p>I produce content for several blogs that I run, as well as this one. My wife is
also a contributor to several sites too. She&rsquo;s not really a technical person, so
I&rsquo;ve also been playing around with a few headless CMS, so that we both can create
content on the go, from anywhere. I think I&rsquo;ve found the one I like now called
Sanity.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll post a review of Sanity in a future blog, along with some of the
other tools I&rsquo;ve been playing around with, such as Netlify, Netlify CMS,
Zeit Now, and the other SSGs that I posted about earlier.</p>

<p>Learning to do front-end web design has been a goal of mine for quite
some time and I&rsquo;m really happy to be working towards it now.</p>

<p>Stay cool everyone - until next time.</p>

  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>That it will never come again<br />
Is what makes life so sweet.<br />
Believing what we don’t believe<br />
Does not exhilarate.</p>

<p>That if it be, it be at best<br />
An ablative estate &ndash;<br />
This instigates an appetite<br />
Precisely opposite.</p>

  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br />
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br />
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br />
But make allowance for their doubting too;<br />
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br />
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br />
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br />
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>

<p>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br />
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br />
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br />
And treat those two impostors just the same;<br />
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br />
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br />
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br />
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:</p>

<p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br />
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br />
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br />
And never breathe a word about your loss;<br />
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br />
To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br />
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br />
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’</p>

<p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br />
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br />
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br />
If all men count with you, but none too much;<br />
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br />
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br />
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br />
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!</p>
</p>

  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>I think that I shall never see<br />
A poem lovely as a tree.</p>

<p>A tree whose hungry mouth is prest<br />
Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;</p>

<p>A tree that looks at God all day,<br />
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;</p>

<p>A tree that may in Summer wear<br />
A nest of robins in her hair;</p>

<p>Upon whose bosom snow has lain;<br />
Who intimately lives with rain.</p>

<p>Poems are made by fools like me,<br />
But only God can make a tree.</p>
