  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>So this is my first mini update of this blog. I&rsquo;ve been learning the technologies
I mentioned in my last post and feel like I&rsquo;m getting the hang of a few things now.
The way this method generates static sites in really incredible. I really like it.
Compared to generating posts in WordPress this really feels like I&rsquo;m doing something
cool and actually programming, as opposed to just making web pages.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep learning as I have a long way to go. One thing that I want to learn is
how to deploy an existing code script into a web app. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get to do that
soon.</p>

  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>So I&rsquo;m getting back into designing websites for fun. I started learning HTML,
CSS and JavaScript several years ago on freecodeCamp and I really enjoyed it,
but somehow got out of practice a few years ago.</p>

<p>I then found WordPress and built quite a few sites in that, but there wasn&rsquo;t
really much coding involved it that. Over the past few years I&rsquo;ve been
practicing using Python quite a bit to write scripts to make my life easier,
some of which I may post here at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve really been getting into static site generators and think I&rsquo;ve
found what I was looking for all those years ago. I love the idea of SSGs and
have been playing around with quite a lot of them, including Gatsby,
Jekyll, 11ty, Middleman, and Hugo (which I&rsquo;m using for this site now).</p>

<p>I produce content for several blogs that I run, as well as this one. My wife is
also a contributor to several sites too. She&rsquo;s not really a technical person, so
I&rsquo;ve also been playing around with a few headless CMS, so that we both can create
content on the go, from anywhere. I think I&rsquo;ve found the one I like now called
Sanity. I&rsquo;ll post a review of Sanity in a future blog, along with some of the
other toolsI&rsquo;ve been playing around with, such as Netlify, Netlify CMS,
Zeit Now, and the other SSGs that I posted about earlier.</p>

<p>Learning to properly do front-end web design has been a goal of mine for quite
some time and I&rsquo;m really happy to be working towards it now.</p>

<p>Stay cool everyone - until next time.</p>

  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>That it will never come again<br />
Is what makes life so sweet.<br />
Believing what we don’t believe<br />
Does not exhilarate.</p>

<p>That if it be, it be at best<br />
An ablative estate &ndash;<br />
This instigates an appetite<br />
Precisely opposite.</p>

  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br />
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br />
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br />
But make allowance for their doubting too;<br />
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br />
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br />
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br />
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>

<p>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br />
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br />
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br />
And treat those two impostors just the same;<br />
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br />
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br />
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br />
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:</p>

<p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br />
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br />
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br />
And never breathe a word about your loss;<br />
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br />
To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br />
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br />
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’</p>

<p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br />
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br />
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br />
If all men count with you, but none too much;<br />
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br />
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br />
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br />
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!</p>
</p>

  <p style="bottom-border: 1px solid;"><p>I think that I shall never see<br />
A poem lovely as a tree.</p>

<p>A tree whose hungry mouth is prest<br />
Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;</p>

<p>A tree that looks at God all day,<br />
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;</p>

<p>A tree that may in Summer wear<br />
A nest of robins in her hair;</p>

<p>Upon whose bosom snow has lain;<br />
Who intimately lives with rain.</p>

<p>Poems are made by fools like me,<br />
But only God can make a tree.</p>
