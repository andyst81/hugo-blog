So I'm getting back into designing websites for fun. I started learning HTML,
CSS and JavaScript several years ago through freecodeCamp and I really enjoyed it,
but somehow got out of practice a few years ago.

When I had a need to build a few websites several years ago, instead of putting
the web design principles that I had already learned, I decided to use WordPress.
I built quite a few sites using WordPress and some themes, but I always felt
that it was kinda cheating - not really web design. I still maintained an interest
in programming, but was mostly focused on learning and using Python. I plan to
write some future blog posts about Python as I really enjoy writing Python scripts.

Recently I've been learning more about static site generators and think I've
found what I was looking for all those years ago. I love the idea of SSGs and
have been playing around with quite a lot of them, including Gatsby,
Jekyll, 11ty, Middleman, and Hugo (which I'm using to build this site).

Of the SSGs that I've been playing around with, I feel that Hugo is the most
straight-forward and fun to use. I'm a bit of a beginner when it comes to GoLang,
but I really like the idea of it, and it seems to make most sense to me. I will
look further into 11ty and Gatsby for future projects as I really enjoyed
playing around with both of them.

I produce content for several blogs that I run, as well as this one. My wife is
also a contributor to several sites too. She's not really a technical person, so
I've also been playing around with a few headless CMS, so that we both can create
content on the go, from anywhere. I think I've found the one I like now called
Sanity.

I'll post a review of Sanity in a future blog, along with some of the
other tools I've been playing around with, such as Netlify, Netlify CMS,
Zeit Now, and the other SSGs that I posted about earlier.

Learning to do front-end web design has been a goal of mine for quite
some time and I'm really happy to be working towards it now.

Stay cool everyone - until next time.
