So I'm getting back into designing websites for fun. I started learning HTML,
CSS and JavaScript several years ago on freecodeCamp and I really enjoyed it,
but somehow got out of practice a few years ago.

I then found WordPress and built quite a few sites in that, but there wasn't
really much coding involved it that. Over the past few years I've been
practicing using Python quite a bit to write scripts to make my life easier,
some of which I may post here at some point in the future.

Recently I've really been getting into static site generators and think I've
found what I was looking for all those years ago. I love the idea of SSGs and
have been playing around with quite a lot of them, including Gatsby,
Jekyll, 11ty, Middleman, and Hugo (which I'm using for this site now).

I produce content for several blogs that I run, as well as this one. My wife is
also a contributor to several sites too. She's not really a technical person, so
I've also been playing around with a few headless CMS, so that we both can create
content on the go, from anywhere. I think I've found the one I like now called
Sanity. I'll post a review of Sanity in a future blog, along with some of the
other toolsI've been playing around with, such as Netlify, Netlify CMS,
Zeit Now, and the other SSGs that I posted about earlier.

Learning to properly do front-end web design has been a goal of mine for quite
some time and I'm really happy to be working towards it now.

Stay cool everyone - until next time.
