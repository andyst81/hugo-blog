So it's been a while since I posted an update on this blog. I guess it seems like
I've been taking a break from coding, but that's not exactly accurate. Before starting
this site, I spent a lot of time looking at the many web design tools and decided
that I wanted to use an SSG to create this blog.  

I investigated all the major SSGs, Hugo, Gatsby, Jekyll, 11ty and more and decided that
Hugo was the best for me as it seemed to have the shortest entry barrier. I still think
this is accurate, but I've since learned that there are quite a few things that
are a bit more complicated with Hugo as I'm not very experienced using Go.  

So, in the time I've been away from this blog, I've been trying to build another site
using Hugo. My wife is a photographer and artist, so I've been building her portfolio
website and been running into a few problems trying to achieve the functions that
she would like to add.  

 As such, I've been trying to learn Go, but also on the lookout for alternatives
 to see if Hugo really is the right tool for that project. I've also been studying
 React and looking at other toold and I think I may have found my answer. I will
 continue using Hugo for this site, but I plan to develop my wife's site using
 Gatsby.  

 I've also been learning React a bit more, as it's an interesting framework to know.
 Since learning more about it, I've revisited Gatsby, which was one of the tools
 I considered before building this blog. Basically, I believe Gatsby is the tool
 I need to use to build my wife's portfolio site as I feel more confident creating
 more complex objects using it. Let's see. Hopefully I'll post a few more specific
 updates as that site is progressing, along with a link to the actual finished site.
