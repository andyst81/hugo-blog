I think that I shall never see  
A poem lovely as a tree.

A tree whose hungry mouth is prest  
Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast;

A tree that looks at God all day,  
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;

A tree that may in Summer wear  
A nest of robins in her hair;

Upon whose bosom snow has lain;  
Who intimately lives with rain.

Poems are made by fools like me,  
But only God can make a tree.
