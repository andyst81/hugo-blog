I've been working on this blog for some time now and I think it's worthwhile
to document what I've done so far, just in case it's helpful for other people.
I mentioned in a previous post that I'm building this site with Hugo static site
generator. Initially I followed a tutorial from Zachary Wade Betz, on how to
build a Hugo blog from scratch. The tutorial can be found here:
![Hugo Tutorial](https://zwbetz.com/make-a-hugo-blog-from-scratch/) and truly is
a great way to get accustomed to the structure of Hugo and how to use it to build
a great website.

If you follow the tutorial, you will see the similarities in styling between this
site and the one created in the tutorial.
