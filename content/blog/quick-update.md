So this is my first mini update of this blog. I've been learning the technologies
I mentioned in my last post and feel like I'm getting the hang of a few things now.
The way this method generates static sites in really incredible. I really like it.
Compared to generating posts in WordPress this really feels like I'm doing something
cool and actually programming, as opposed to just making web pages.

I'll keep learning as I have a long way to go. One thing that I want to learn is
how to deploy an existing code script into a web app. Hopefully I'll get to do that
soon.
