This is my first mini update of this blog. I've been learning more and more about Hugo to build out this website and feel like I'm getting the hang of it now. I think Hugo
is a great, easy to access SSG that is incredibly powerful and so fast. The way
it generates static sites is really quite incredible. I really like it. There has
been a bit of a learning curve, and there are still plenty of things that I
still don't know how to do, but it hasn't been anywhere near as complicated as
I thought it would be. As a bonus, compared to generating posts in WordPress
this really feels like I'm doing something cool and actually programming,
as opposed publishing the equivalent of a Word document online.

I'll keep learning as I have a long way to go. I want to make the home page of
this site much better looking and I have many other additions that I'd like to
make. In addition to that, I am still working on my other programming skills.
One thing that I want to learn is how to deploy an existing code script
into a web app. Hopefully I'll get to do that soon.
