    {{ partial "logo.html" . }}By day I work as an executive recruiter in the banking and financial services
    sector. By night I am an avid coding enthusiast.My name is Andy and I am
    using this blog as a catalog of the things I'm learning. I really enjoy
    learning how to code, and have been learning for over 5 years. As the years
    have gone by, I've learned many different languages and techniques.
    <br /><br />
    {{ partial "logo.html" . }}I started learning VBA as a way to make my old work easier many, many years ago.
    My interest and motivation has been a little up and down through the years and
    I have studyied quite a few different courses, including
    <a href="https://freecodecamp.com" class="abt-link"  target="_blank">freecodecamp</a> and
    <a href="https://Codecademy.com" class="abt-link" target="blank"> Codecademy</a> as
    well as several other online resources.
    <br /><br />
    {{ partial "logo.html" . }}Most recently I've been teaching myself Python and have written many simple
    Python scripts to make my life easier. I've also been designing and hosting
    a few websites using WordPress and the Divi theme. WordPress is a good tool,
    but I didn't feel that I was able to increase my programming skills much by
    using it. I've recently decided I want to increase my skillset, and learn more
    about front-end web design, so I've been playing around with a few static site
    generators and CMS systems as well as different ways to get the pages online.
    <br /><br />
    {{ partial "logo.html" . }}This blog is going to be my way of documenting what I'm doing. I'm using
    GitHub along with Atom IDE, ZEIT Now and Hugo at the same time to create this site.
    It's very different to WordPress, but I'm really enjoying it so far.  I hope
    what I find out becomes useful for some people.
